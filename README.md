# Project: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Overview

The goal of this project is to set the data ready for analysis after cleaning.
The database chosen was 'results.csv' whchs stands for all Formula 1 historic race results til 2008.
 
The first challenge was to identify the columns and their data then starting to remove what it is not helpful for our analysis.
I removed the columns with a lot of null values and repeated columns. 
I reorder and rename the columns so just significant data can be in ur final dataset. 
I changed the datatype so it could be easier to work with the data later on.
Finally I applied some filters and melting so I can first interact with the data. 
I tried to get some relevant data about Fernando Alonso during 2008 season. 

I tried to unify it with another dataset which has the drivers names but the file was corrupted so I couldn't. 
In general it was a good start to interact with data for the first time.
